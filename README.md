All For One Build
Created an 11 page web app using tailwind css and flowbite with 10 endpoints to complete various tasks based upon user input. It is responsive for desktop and mobile.

peer commment : The website has a great desgin and everything works well. All the API's display correclty and the input number ones have data validation. Both desktop and mobile are responive and nothing seems out of place for the desgin. One suggestion I have is that you could maybe organize the app.js by instead having each of the lets and fetch be for their specifc page be in their own seperate .js file. Overall Everything works great and Jerrod did a great job on this project.
